# Python Runtime Sandbox

This example implements a simple Python server in a sandbox container. 
It includes a FastAPI server that can execute commands and a Python script to test it (`tester.py`).

Test it out by running `run-test-docker`:
It will build a (local) container image containing the python server,run it, then execute `tester.py` to test the running container and a cleanup.

The `tester.py` script acts as a client to interact with the python API server, sending a command to the `/execute` endpoint and printing the standard output, standard error, and exit code from the response.

Usage:
`python tester.py [ip] [port]`

## Python Classes in `main.py`

The `main.py` file defines the following Pydantic models to ensure type-safe data for the API endpoints:

### `ExecuteRequest`
This class models the request body for the `/execute` endpoint.
- **`command: str`**: The shell command to be executed in the sandbox.
- **`timeout_seconds: float | None`** (optional): Per-request time limit, in
  seconds. Must be greater than `0`. It can only shorten
  `SANDBOX_EXEC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, never extend it; when omitted, the
  server-wide limit applies.

### `ExecuteResponse`
This class models the response body for the `/execute` endpoint.
- **`stdout: str`**: The standard output from the executed command.
- **`stderr: str`**: The standard error from the executed command.
- **`exit_code: int`**: The exit code of the executed command, or `124` if it
  was killed for exceeding its time limit (the GNU `timeout` convention).
- **`timed_out: bool`**: `true` when the command was killed for exceeding its
  time limit. `stdout` and `stderr` then hold whatever it wrote before it was
  killed, followed by a note on `stderr`.

### Configuration

- **`SANDBOX_EXEC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`**: Maximum time, in seconds, a command
  submitted to `/execute` is allowed to run before it (and any processes it
  spawned) are killed and the response reports `timed_out: true`. Defaults
  to `300`. If set to a value that isn't a finite number greater than `0`,
  the default is used instead and a warning is logged.
- **`SANDBOX_BASE_DIR`**: Directory that commands run from and that file
  operations (`/upload`, `/download`, `/list`, `/exists`) are confined to.
  Defaults to `/app`. Pointing it at a writable volume (e.g. an `emptyDir`
  mounted at `/workspace`) keeps the runtime's own code out of the working
  area and lets the container run with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`.

### File paths

URL-encode the relative path once for `/download`, `/list`, and `/exists`.
Use `urllib.parse.quote(path, safe="/")` to leave directory separators readable.
Encoding the separators with `safe=""` also works: the HTTP server decodes
`%2F` to `/` before routing. A literal `%2F` in a file or directory name must
be sent as `%252F`, so it remains part of the name rather than a separator.
Likewise, a filename containing literal `%20` uses `%2520` in the request URL.

## Testing on a local kind cluster using agent-sandbox

To test the sandbox on a local [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster, you can use the `run-test-kind.sh` script.
This script will:
1.  Create a kind cluster (if it doesn't exist).
2.  Build and deploy the agent sandbox controller to the cluster.
3.  Build the python runtime sandbox image.
4.  Load the image into the kind cluster.
5.  Deploy the sandbox and run the tests using examples/python-runtime-sandbox/sandbox-python-kind.yaml
6.  Clean up all the resources.

To run the script:
```bash
./run-test-kind.sh
```
