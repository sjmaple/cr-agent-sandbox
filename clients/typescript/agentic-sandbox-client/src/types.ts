 *   data path. The Service only ever selects its own Sandbox's pod, and a

 *   createSandbox()/getSandbox() throw SandboxNoServiceError when the Sandbox
 *   has no Service instead of falling back to the pod IP.
 * - `"in-cluster-pod-ip"`: dials status.podIPs (IPv4 preferred). Needs no
 *   Service, but nothing detects that the pod was rescheduled: requests can
 *   continue to a stale address Kubernetes may have reassigned to an
 *   unrelated pod.
 *
 * Both in-cluster modes require this process to run inside the same cluster
 * as the sandbox pods, and send REST and gRPC in plaintext across the pod
